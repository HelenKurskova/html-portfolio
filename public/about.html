<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was working for 15+ years as a member of translation team as both DTP publishsing engineer and translator of technical manuals.</p>

<p>The thing I enjoy the most - is to see as the leaflet/project/webpage is being created - from nothing to something beautiful and useful. It is about bringing the value and meaning into reality. About creating system and order.</p>
